# Fully-Pipelined-RISC32IM-Processor

A 5-stage pipelined processor from scratch, compliant with the RISC32IM instruction set architecture. Contains modules for instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback. Handles hazards using data forwarding and pipeline stalls.

This is a project for the Computer Architecture course by Dr. Cherif Salama at the American University in Cairo.

The project is a full pipelined CPU supporting all the RISC32IM instructions.

The project contains a single ported memory used for storing Instructions and Data. The first half of the memory is reserved for the data and the other half is for the instructions with an offset of 256.

## Test Cases Generator

The project comes with a C++ program that generates random instructions in hexadecimal to test the CPU.

## How to run tests

For testing, the Data and the Instructions need to be filled into the memory before running. Instructions can be fetched from an external txt file as long as they are represented in hexadecimal base. However, the initial Data needs to be stored manually and cannot be generated by the C++ program or fetched from an external file.
